<ENTER> duplicate START to END
<ENTER> duplicate START by STEP to END
<ENTER> duplicate ITEM1 ITEM2 ... ITEMn
<ENTER> duplicate PAD zeros START to END

This procedure duplicates the marked range, but replaces the dollar sign
($) with a different value each time.  For example, if the following were
the marked range:

    Dear $, How are you?

And the command was: <ENTER> duplicate Julia Ayala Simon
The following would be inserted into the file:

    Dear Julia, How are you?
    Dear Ayala, How are you?
    Dear Simon, How are you?

Dupliacte recognizes the word "to" and "by" as special to allow you to
specify numerical values for $

    <ENTER> duplicate 1 to 10

will replcae $ with 1, then 2, then 3...to 10.

    <ENTER> duplicate 1 by 3 to 10
will act like the usual FOR-BY-TO POP11 loop.

    <ENTER> duplicate 3 zeros 45 to 49
acts like other numeric duplicates, but pads the number to be 3 digits
long (in this case).  E.g., 045 046 047 048 049.
