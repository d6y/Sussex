\chapter{The First Chapter}

You know, this isn't really a DPhil thesis.  Nah, it's just a few pages I
wrote to try out a particular layout style.  Yes, a lot of people are
fooled by it, but there's actually no real ``contribution to knowledge''
anywhere in this document.  Still, that never stopped anyone in the past,
eh?  Ha ha.

Well, if this really is a test file, I'd better try out a bit of italics.
{\em This sentence no verb.}  I don't use {\bf bold} very often, so I won't
bother with it.

\section{A section heading}

I should look at how maths and fixed-font stuff works in this style. The
procedure \verb|wrong()| will produce the wrong result for any problem
given to it, using $n_i(t) = \alpha w_{ij} x_j(t-1)$.
Here's an example:

\par\bigskip\par\bugitem{imagineC}{added-imaginary-column} \nopagebreak The subject went on to write an answer for a column that didn't exist.\nopagebreak\par\nopagebreak\medskip\nopagebreak\noindent
\begin{tabular}{lr}Buswell&0.21\%\\\end{tabular}\hfil \begin{arithprob}{lll}
&$6_{\ }$&$9_{\ }$\\
$+$&$1_{\ }$&$2_{\ }$\\
\cline{1-3}$1_{\ }$&$8_{1}$&$1_{\ }$\\
\end{arithprob}

\subsection{A subsection heading}

I think that's enough for now.
