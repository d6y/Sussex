                CHILDREN'S ARITHMETIC AND CONNECTIONISM

Talk presented at IOT91 --- The 4th White House COGS PG Workshop
         Isle of Thorns Conference Centre, 17--19th July 1991

ABSTRACT: Theories in cognitive science are in danger of being overly
constrained by the methods of symbolic AI.  There seems to be no
reason to adhere to the kind of computations available on conventional
computers when attempting to model cognition.  Connectionism is
changing the way we think about cognition, and as such is changing the
kinds of computations available to model cognition. Cognitivism is
urged to move towards a `hybrid systems' approach, incorporating many
styles of computation.  In particular, Kurt VanLehn's [1990] theory of
children's subtraction is presented as a
candidate for revision by connectionism.

                     HOW DO CHILDREN FOLLOW RULES?

                 Tuesday 4 December 1990, 3.30pm 5C11

ABSTRACT: For some behaviours, children have been viewed as rule
following devices (production systems). Although such systems
have achieved a certain amount of success, I want to ask what a
production system explanation is an explanation of... The thought
I want to pursuit is this: classical AI models (i.e., production
systems) are appropriate for the study of some aspects the mind
after revision (not rejection) by connectionism. For those who
have read it, this is just my thesis proposal ("Serial processing in
parallel networks") --- same tune, slightly different words.

      SERIAL PROCESSING IN PARALLEL NETWORKS: RESEASRCH PROPOSAL
                        Friday 12 October 1990

A case is presented for viewing a connectionist production system as a
good vehicle for exploring sequential aspects of cognition from within
the connectionist framework.  By taking such an approach it becomes
necessary to examine the issues surrounding the representation of
structured knowledge, and the kinds of operations that can be
performed on such representations.  That is, connectionist symbol
processing becomes the focus of attention in this endeavour. The
models proposed by classical artificial intelligence are taken as
being appropriate for the study of some aspects the mind after
revision (not rejection) by conectionism. It is appropriate,
therefore, to ask how necessary symbol manipulation can be
accommodated by a connectionist brain.

            SERIAL PROCESSING IN PARALLEL NETWORKS: MOTIVES
        Talk presented to The 3rd White House COGS PG Workshop.
       Isle of Thorns Conference Centre, July 23rd -- 25th 1990.

If connectionist networks are to model such high-level cognitive
skills as problem solving, planning, language, game playing, and so
on, they must be able to exhibit rich sequential behaviour. To date
these skills have been best modelled by traditional AI for good
reason: order is implicit in traditional models (e.g., production
systems). However, connectionist methods have now started to emerge
for dealing with sequences, and although not the final word on the
subject, they make it appropriate to consider how connectionism can
embody the clumsy serial behaviour prevalent in human performance. The
problems and importance of serial order are examined, along with
connectionism's role in the understanding of human ordered behaviour.

            SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING IN CONNECTIONIST NETWORKS
         (Talk presented to Sussex PDP Club Wed May 30, 1990)

 There are a number of psychological and physiological processes that
 are temporal in nature (involving ordered sequences of events).
 Traditional AI seems to have the upper-hand when building models of
 such processes (e.g., production systems vs. ``parallelized''
 connectionist networks, where temporal problems are simply converted
 to spatial problems).  However, there are now methods available to
 connectionists wanting to tackle temporal phenomenon. This talk will
 describe a selection of these methods.
