ABSTRACT:

Mastering the simple number facts, such as the one hundred multiplications
(0x0 to 9x9), requires five or six years of classroom drill.

Despite this (or perhaps because of it) children and adults have difficulty
in recalling these facts.

I'll present a connectionist account of mental multiplication which models
adult reaction time and error patterns.

When it comes to analysing the model, the conclusion is that it may be
better to think of connectionist models as "animal models", rather than as
theory simulations.
