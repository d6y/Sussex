\ldots procedural nets and PSs differ in their view of the psychological
nature of subtraction errors.  According to \citeA{buggy}, children make
errors because they have a faulty version of certain components of the
skill. According to PSs, the errors are made primarily because certain
components are missing.

These ``missing components'' could be skills that just haven't be learned
yet (e.g., knowing what to do with the second multiplier); or they could
just be a missing condition for trigereing a skill (e.g., not knowing how
to add up the partial product of a multiplication).

The connectionist account suggests that errors are due to incorrect
state transitions.  This can be viewed as having a condition which triggers
the wrong skill, or fails to trigger the correct skill.
