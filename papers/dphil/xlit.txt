When asked to recall answers to two digit multiplication problems ``as
quickly and accurately as possible'' \cite{camp85}, both children and
adults exhibit well documented patterns of behaviour. In general, response
times (RTs) increase across the multiplication tables: problems in the nine
times table tend to take longer to answer than problems in the two times
table. However, this ``problem size effect'' has plenty of exceptions
(e.g., the five times table is much faster than its position would
suggest---see figure~\ref{f:rtplot}).  In addition, ``tie'' problems (\x22,
\x33 etc.)\ are recalled relatively quickly.
\citeA{camp85} found that adults under mild time pressure make errors at
the rate of 7.65 per cent, and 92.6 per cent of those errors fall into the
following five categories (after \citeA{mcclmode}):
%%
\begin{itemize}
%%
\item Operand errors, for which the erroneous product is correct for a
problem that shares a digit (operand) with the presented problem
(e.g., $\x64=36$, because the problem shares 4 with $\x94=36$).
%%
\item Close operand errors, a subclass of operand errors, where the
erroneous product is also close in magnitude to the correct product. That
is, for the problem \x{a}{b}, the error will often be correct for the
problem ($a\pm2) \times b$ or $a \times (b\pm2)$ (e.g., $\x64=28$).  This
phenomenon is referred to as the ``operand distance effect''.
%%
\item Frequent product errors, where the error is
one of the five products 12, 16, 18, 24 or 36.
%%
\item Table errors, where the erroneous product is the correct answer to
some problem in the range \x22 to \x99,
but the problem does not share any digits with the presented
problem (e.g., \x64=15).
%%
\item Operation errors, where the error to \x a b is correct for $a+b$.
\end{itemize}

Despite being drilled on the multiplication tables at school, children and
adults make these systematic slips in recall. The problem is to produce a
model which has correctly learnt the multiplication tables, yet can make
slips when recalling answers. Given the observations on the types of
erroneous responses, and the RT for correct responses, what assumptions
must be made to account for these phenomena? The model presented here
suggests that the initial skew in the frequency and order of presentation
of multiplication facts \cite[p.~118]{camprole} is one of the important
factors.
