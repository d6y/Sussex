Friends and enemies effect in mental arithmetic
===============================================

During development, A given PROBLEM (and it's compliment) can have a
number of:

    - friends, those problmes that do NOT result in the
      same product (answer), and

    - enemies, those products that DO result in the same answer.

Obviously there will be more enemies than friends, but the proportion of
each will vary for each problem.

We can check this by looking at the development of PSS over a number of
epochs.   The same set of problems with large enemies/friends ratios
should be hard to learn, resulting in slow RT.  We might expect differences
due to the initial random weights.
